## Javascript Under Pressure

5 simple functions are stubbed out with instructions on what they receive as arguments
and what they should return.
Your task is to complete the body of the function to pass the spec tests created.

#### Do not modify spec tests.

Do the test in this order:

1. doubleInteger
2. isNumberEven
3. getFileExtension
4. longestString
5. arraySum

#### To start the exercise run:

```bash
$ npm install
```

#### To test your code:
```bash
$ npm test
```

You have half an hour to finish the exercise.
